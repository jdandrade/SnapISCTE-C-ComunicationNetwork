# SnapISCTE-C-ComunicationNetwork

Text based comunication (kind of like a text only SnapChat) between users using C - fork/msg/sem/shm.

Client - Server Application. Being src/snapiscte.c the server and src/snapclient.c the client.

### How to run

- Compile .c files with make or gcc;

- Run Server first;
 
- Run as many Clients as you want;
 
- Login information has to match, to "create new logins" you can use this project: https://github.com/jdandrade/SnapISCTE-BashUserDataManagement or change file utilizadores.txt (last column is sha1 protected password)

### Left to do

Need to clean some code and add some documentation.
